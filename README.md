# Question_Answering_System_Using_LlamaIndex_And_OpenAI
This project demonstrates the implementation of a Question-Answering (QA) System using LlamaIndex and OpenAI. The system is designed to extract answers from web pages and document files (like PDFs and text files) using vector embeddings and similarity searches.

# Features
## 1.Website-Based QA
Extracts answers from the content of a web page by passing the URL.

- Dynamically fetches content from the website.
- Processes and queries the content for relevant answers.

## 2.Document-Based QA
Extracts answers from files like PDFs or text documents.

- Uses vector embeddings to represent document content.
- Performs similarity searches to find relevant sections for the query.

## Technologies Used

- LlamaIndex: For document parsing, indexing, and query handling.
- OpenAI API: To generate and enhance the quality of answers.
- Vector Embeddings: For similarity-based information retrieval.

# Future Enhancements

- Add support for more document types like Word files.
- Enhance answer retrieval using advanced ranking algorithms.
- Implement a web interface for easier interaction.
